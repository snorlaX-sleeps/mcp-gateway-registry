## What is MCP Gateway & Registry?

The **MCP Gateway & Registry** is a unified platform designed for centralizing access to both MCP Servers and AI Agents using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It serves three core functions:

1. **Unified MCP Server Gateway** – Centralized access point for multiple MCP servers
2. **MCP Servers Registry** – Register, discover, and manage access to MCP servers with unified governance
3. **Agent Registry & A2A Communication Hub** – Agent registration, discovery, governance, and direct agent-to-agent communication through the [A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/)

The platform integrates with external registries such as Anthropic's MCP Registry (and more to come), providing a single control plane for both tool access, agent orchestration, and agent-to-agent communication patterns.

**Why unified?** Instead of managing hundreds of individual MCP server configurations, agent connections, and separate governance systems across your development teams, this platform provides secure, governed access to curated MCP servers and registered agents through a single, unified control plane.

**Transform this chaos:**
```
❌ AI agents require separate connections to each MCP server
❌ Each developer configures VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code individually
❌ Developers must install and manage MCP servers locally
❌ No standard authentication flow for enterprise tools
❌ Scattered API keys and credentials across tools
❌ No visibility into what tools teams are using
❌ Security risks from unmanaged tool sprawl
❌ No dynamic tool discovery for autonomous agents
❌ No curated tool catalog for multi-tenant environments
❌ A2A provides agent cards but no way for agents to discover other agents
❌ Maintaining separate MCP server and agent registries is a non-starter for governance
❌ Impossible to maintain unified policies across server and agent access
```

**Into this organized approach:**
```
✅ AI agents connect to one gateway, access multiple MCP servers
✅ Single configuration point for VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code
✅ Central IT manages cloud-hosted MCP infrastructure via streamable HTTP
✅ Developers use standard OAuth 2LO/3LO flows for enterprise MCP servers
✅ Centralized credential management with secure vault integration
✅ Complete visibility and audit trail for all tool usage
✅ Security features with governed tool access
✅ Dynamic tool discovery and invocation for autonomous workflows
✅ Registry provides discoverable, curated MCP servers for multi-tenant use
✅ Agents can discover and communicate with other agents through unified Agent Registry
✅ Single control plane for both MCP servers and agent governance
✅ Unified policies and audit trails for both server and agent access
```

> **Note on Agent-to-Agent Communication:** AI Agents discover other AI Agents through the unified Agent Registry and communicate with them **directly** (peer-to-peer) without routing through the MCP Gateway. The Registry handles discovery, authentication, and access control, while agents maintain direct connections for efficient, low-latency communication.

## Unified Agent & Server Registry

This platform serves as a comprehensive, unified registry supporting:

- ✅ **MCP Server Registration & Discovery** – Register, discover, and manage access to MCP servers
- ✅ **AI Agent Registration & Discovery** – Register agents and enable them to discover other agents
- ✅ **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication** – Direct agent-to-agent communication patterns using the A2A protocol
- ✅ **Multi-Protocol Support** – Support for various agent communication protocols and patterns
- ✅ **Unified Governance** – Single policy and access control system for both agents and servers
- ✅ **Cross-Protocol Agent Discovery** – Agents can discover each other regardless of implementation
- ✅ **Integrated External Registries** – Connect with Anthropic's MCP Registry and other external sources
- ✅ **Agent Cards & Metadata** – Rich metadata for agent capabilities, skills, and authentication schemes

Key distinction: **Unlike separate point solutions, this unified registry eliminates the need to maintain separate MCP server and agent systems**, providing a single control plane for agent orchestration, MCP server access, and agent-to-agent communication.

## What's New

- **Virtual MCP Server Support** - Aggregate tools, resources, and prompts from multiple backend MCP servers into a single unified endpoint. Clients connect to one virtual server that presents a curated, access-controlled view of capabilities from any combination of registered backends. Features include tool aliasing (resolve naming conflicts), version pinning (lock to specific backend versions), per-tool scope-based access control, session multiplexing (one client session maps to N backend sessions transparently), and 60-second cached aggregation for `tools/list`, `resources/list`, and `prompts/list`. Supports all MCP JSON-RPC methods including `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/call`, `resources/read`, and `prompts/get`. [Design Document](docs/design/virtual-mcp-server.md) | [Operations Guide](docs/virtual-server-operations.md)

- **Registry-Only Deployment Mode** - Run the registry as a standalone catalog/discovery service without nginx gateway integration. In `registry-only` mode, nginx configuration is not updated when servers are registered, and MCP proxy requests return 503 with instructions to use direct connection. The frontend adapts to show `proxy_pass_url` instead of gateway URLs. Combined with `REGISTRY_MODE` settings (`full`, `skills-only`, `mcp-servers-only`, `agents-only`), you can configure the registry for specific use cases. For example, set `REGISTRY_MODE=skills-only` to run a dedicated Skills Registry that only manages Agent Skills (SKILL.md files) without MCP servers or A2A agents - ideal for teams that want a lightweight skill library. The UI automatically adapts to show only relevant features, and API endpoints for disabled features return 503. Invalid combinations like `with-gateway + skills-only` are auto-corrected with warnings. [Registry Deployment Modes Guide](docs/registry-deployment-modes.md)

- **Agent Skills Registry** - Register, discover, and manage reusable instruction sets (SKILL.md files) that enhance AI coding assistants with specialized workflows. Skills are hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and registered in the MCP Gateway Registry for discovery and access control. Features include YAML frontmatter parsing for metadata extraction, health monitoring with URL accessibility checks, visibility controls (public/private/group), star ratings, semantic search integration, tool dependency validation, and a rich UI with SKILL.md content modals. Security includes SSRF protection with redirect validation. [Agent Skills Guide](docs/agent-skills-operational-guide.md) | [Architecture](docs/design/agent-skills-architecture.md)

- **📋 Compliance Audit Logging** - Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring and compliance. Captures all Registry API and MCP Gateway access events with user identity, operation details, and timing. Features include automatic credential masking (tokens, cookies, passwords are never logged), TTL-based log retention (default 7 days, configurable), admin-only audit viewer UI with filtering and export (JSONL/CSV), and non-blocking async design. Supports SOC 2 and GDPR requirements with who/what/when/where/outcome tracking. [Audit Logging Guide](docs/audit-logging.md)

- **🌐 Peer-to-Peer Registry Federation** - Connect multiple MCP Gateway Registry instances for bidirectional server and agent synchronization. Central IT teams can aggregate visibility across Line of Business registries, or LOBs can inherit shared tools from a central hub. Features include configurable sync modes (all, whitelist, tag filter), scheduled and on-demand sync, static token authentication for IdP-agnostic deployments, Fernet-encrypted credential storage, generation-based orphan detection, and path namespacing to prevent collisions. Synced items are read-only and display their source registry. A VS Code-style Settings UI provides peer management, sync triggering, and status monitoring. [Architecture Design](docs/design/federation-architecture.md) | [Operational Guide](docs/federation-operational-guide.md)

- **🔑 Static Token Auth for Registry API** - Access Registry API endpoints (`/api/*`, `/v0.1/*`) using a static API key instead of IdP-based JWT validation. Designed for trusted network environments, CI/CD pipelines, and CLI tooling where configuring a full identity provider may not be practical. MCP Gateway endpoints continue to require full IdP authentication. Includes startup validation that disables the feature if no token is configured. [Static Token Auth Guide](docs/static-token-auth.md)

- **🔀 MCP Server Version Routing** - Run multiple versions of the same MCP server simultaneously behind a single gateway endpoint. Register new versions as inactive, test them with the `X-MCP-Server-Version` header, then promote to active with a single API call or UI click. Features include instant rollback, version pinning for clients, deprecation lifecycle with sunset dates, automatic nginx map-based O(1) routing, cascade deletion of all versions, and post-swap health checks. The dashboard displays both the admin-controlled routing version and the MCP server-reported software version independently. Only the active version appears in search results and health checks. [Design Document](docs/design/server-versioning.md) | [Operations Guide](docs/server-versioning-operations.md)
- **👥 Multi-Provider IAM with Harmonized API** - Full Identity and Access Management support for both Keycloak and Microsoft Entra ID. The registry API provides a unified experience for user and group management regardless of which IdP you use. Human users can log in via the UI and generate self-signed JWT tokens (with the same permissions as their session) for CLI tools and AI coding assistants. Service accounts (M2M) enable AI agent identity with OAuth2 Client Credentials flow. Fine-grained access control through scopes defines exactly which MCP servers, methods, tools, and agents each user can access. [Authentication Design](docs/design/authentication-design.md) | [IdP Provider Architecture](docs/design/idp-provider-support.md) | [Scopes Management](docs/scopes-mgmt.md) | [Entra ID Setup](docs/entra-id-setup.md)
- **🏷️ Custom Metadata for Servers & Agents** - Add rich custom metadata to MCP servers and agents for organization, compliance, and integration tracking.

Updated llms.txt provides comprehensive documentation for LLM coding assistants covering storage backend migration (file → DocumentDB/MongoDB), repository patterns, AWS ECS deployment, Microsoft Entra ID integration, dual security scanning, federation architecture, rating system, testing standards, and critical code organization antipatterns. [Testing Guide](docs/testing/README.md) | [docs/llms.txt](docs/llms.txt)
- **📊 DocumentDB & MongoDB CE Storage Backend** - Production-grade distributed storage with MongoDB-compatible backends. DocumentDB provides native HNSW vector search for sub-100ms semantic queries in production deployments, while MongoDB Community Edition 8.2 enables full-featured local development with replica sets. Both backends use the same repository abstraction layer with automatic collection management, optimized indexes, and application-level vector search for MongoDB CE. Switch between MongoDB CE (local testing) and DocumentDB (production) with a single environment variable. Note: File-based storage is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## A2A Agents - Example Implementations

The registry includes two example A2A agents that demonstrate how both human developers and autonomous AI agents can discover, register, and use agents through the unified Agent Registry. Agents can programmatically discover other agents via semantic search and use them through the A2A protocol, enabling dynamic agent composition and autonomous agent orchestration.

### Example Agents

| Agent | Path | Skills |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Travel Assistant Agent** | `/travel-assistant-agent` | Flight search, pricing checks, recommendations, trip planning |
| **Flight Booking Agent** | `/flight-booking-agent` | Availability checks, flight reservations, payments, reservation management |

### Agent Discovery

**View in Registry UI:**
Open the registry and navigate to the **A2A Agents** tab to browse registered agents with their full metadata, capabilities, and skills.

**Search via CLI:**
Developers can search for agents by natural language description:

```bash
# Search for agents that can help book a trip
cli/agent_mgmt.sh search "need an agent to book a trip"
```

**Example Output:**
```
Found 4 agent(s) matching 'need an agent to book a trip':
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent Name                               | Path                      | Score
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Travel Assistant Agent                   | /travel-assistant-agent   |  0.8610
Flight Booking Agent                     | /flight-booking-agent     |  1.2134
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Agent-to-Agent Discovery API

The registry provides a **semantic search API** that agents can use as a tool to discover other A2A agents at runtime. This API enables dynamic agent composition where agents find collaborators based on capabilities rather than hardcoded references.

**Discovery API Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/agents/discover/semantic?query=<natural-language-query>&max_results=5
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

**Response includes:**
- Agent name, description, and endpoint URL
- Agent card metadata with skills and capabilities
- Relevance score for ranking matches
- Trust level and visibility settings

**How agents use it:**
1. An agent calls the registry's semantic search API with a natural language query (e.g., "agent that can book flights")
2. The registry returns matching agents with their endpoint URLs and full agent card metadata
3. The agent uses the agent card to understand capabilities and invokes the discovered agent via A2A protocol

**Example - Travel Assistant discovering and invoking Flight Booking Agent:**
```
User: "I need to book a flight from NYC to LA"

Travel Assistant:
  1. Calls registry API: POST /api/agents/discover/semantic?query="book flights"
  2. Registry returns Flight Booking Agent with endpoint URL and agent card
  3. Uses agent card to understand capabilities, then sends A2A message to Flight Booking Agent
  4. Returns booking confirmation to user
```

This pattern enables agents to dynamically extend their capabilities by discovering specialized agents for tasks they cannot handle directly.

**Agent Cards:** View the agent card metadata at [agents/a2a/test/](agents/a2a/test/) to see the complete agent definitions including skills, protocols, and capabilities.

For complete agent deployment and testing documentation, see [agents/a2a/README.md](agents/a2a/README.md).

---
## Quick Start

There are 3 options for setting up the MCP Gateway & Registry:

- **Option A: Pre-built Images** — Fastest setup using pre-built Docker or Podman containers. Recommended for most users.
- **Option B: Podman (Rootless)** — Detailed Podman-specific instructions for macOS and rootless Linux environments.
- **Option C: Build from Source** — Full source build for customization or development.

### Option A: Pre-built Images (Instant Setup)

Get running with pre-built Docker containers in minutes. This is the recommended approach for most users.

```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry.git
cd mcp-gateway-registry
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your passwords (KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD, etc.)
nano .env

# Deploy with pre-built images
export DOCKERHUB_ORG=mcpgateway
./build_and_run.sh --prebuilt

# Access the Registry UI
open http://localhost:7860  # macOS
# xdg-open http://localhost:7860  # Linux
```

**[Complete Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md)** - Full step-by-step instructions including:
- Prerequisites installation (Docker, Python, UV)
- Environment configuration
- MongoDB and Keycloak initialization
- User and service account setup
- Server and agent registration
- Testing the gateway functionality

**Benefits:** No build time | No Node.js required | No frontend compilation | Consistent tested images

---

### Option B: Podman (Rootless Container Deployment)

**Perfect for macOS and rootless Linux environments**

Podman provides rootless container execution without requiring privileged ports, making it ideal for:
- **macOS** users with Podman Desktop
- **Linux** users preferring rootless containers
- **Development** environments where Docker daemon isn't available

**Quick Podman Setup (macOS non-Apple Silicon):**

```bash
# Install Podman Desktop
brew install podman-desktop
# OR download from: https://podman-desktop.io/
```

Inside Podman Desktop, go to Preferences > Podman Machine and create a new machine with at least 4 CPUs and 8GB RAM. Alternatively, see more detailed [Podman installation guide](docs/installation.md#podman-installation) for instructions on setting this up on CLI.

```bash
# Initialize Podman machine
podman machine init
podman machine start

# Verify installation
podman --version
podman compose version

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

**Deploy with Podman** see full Podman setup instructions (downloading, installing, and initializing a first Podman container, as well as troubleshooting) in our [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md#podman-installation).

**Build with Podman:**

```bash
# Auto-detect (will use Podman if Docker not available)
./build_and_run.sh --prebuilt

# Explicit Podman mode (only non-Apple Silicon)
./build_and_run.sh --prebuilt --podman

# Access registry at non-privileged ports
# On macOS:
open http://localhost:8080
# On Linux: xdg-open http://localhost:8080
```

> Note: **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)?** Don't use `--prebuilt` with Podman on ARM64. This will cause a "proxy already running" error. See [Podman on Apple Silicon Guide](docs/podman-apple-silicon.md).

```bash
# To run on Apple Silicon Macs:
./build_and_run.sh --podman
```

**Key Differences vs. Docker:**
- No root/sudo required
- Works on macOS without privileged port access
- HTTP port: `8080` (instead of `80`)
- HTTPS port: `8443` (instead of `443`)
- All other service ports unchanged

For detailed Podman setup instructions, see [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md#podman-installation) and [macOS Setup Guide](docs/macos-setup-guide.md#podman-deployment).

### Option C: Build from Source

**New to MCP Gateway?** Start with our [Complete Setup Guide](docs/complete-setup-guide.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions from scratch on AWS EC2.

**Running on macOS?** See our [macOS Setup Guide](docs/macos-setup-guide.md) for platform-specific instructions and optimizations.
